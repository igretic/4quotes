My very first Android application!
The majority of the code is pretty straight-forward, I implemented all that we learned from Catherine and Kunal. I also tried to follow
advice from Forum Mentors regarding putting attribute values into their respective .xml resource files, instead of hard-coding them into
the main layout files.
The swiping part we did not learn yet, so I reached for the online resources to see how it is done. Although I had no past experience 
with java and OOP, I manage to implement the code through standard trial-and-error path. I still don't fully understand it, but I'm eager
to learn it, after I saw all the things you could accomplish with java. I believe that even for a slightly more complicated code than
our birthday cards java will be neccessary.
